- How does the problem generalize? A real world problem
- Why did you choose these two as fitness parameters?
- Have a graph of success probablity along with the size of the search space.
- How does different function parameters play a role in determining the fitness?

====
- Small mesh wires will not observe difference in the gain pattern, and coupling
- Plot RP of freespace and in the presence of platforms, and antennas

- legacy antennas make the problem more interesting; frequency bands change over time and new antennas are needed therefore one needs to find new placements.
- mutual coupling and radiation pattern are independent
- classic and polular antennas used
