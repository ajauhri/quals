- How does the problem generalize? A real world problem
- Why did you choose these two as fitness parameters?
- Have a graph of success probablity along with the size of the search space.
- How does different function parameters play a role in determining the fitness?

- Small mesh wires will not observe difference in the gain pattern, and coupling
- Plot RP of freespace and in the presence of platforms, and antennas
